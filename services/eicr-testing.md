## What is an EICR?
An **Electrical Installation Condition Report (EICR)** is a formal document that is produced following an assessment of the electrical installation within a property. It must be carried out by an experienced qualified electrician or approved contractor.

### Why do you need it?
Under the **Health and Safety at Work Act 1974**, employers are responsible for the health and safety of their employees and the public. 
* Avoid invalidated insurance claims.
* Ensure safety of staff.
* Comply with **BS 7671** wiring regulations.

### Our Process
1.  **Visual Inspection**: We check for obvious damage.
2.  **Dead Testing**: Connectivity and insulation resistance.
3.  **Live Testing**: Earth fault loop impedance and RCD testing.
4.  **Reporting**: You receive a digital PDF report within 24 hours.

> **Note:** Reaction Group engineers are fully NICEIC accredited, ensuring your documentation stands up to any audit.
