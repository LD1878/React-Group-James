## What is Fixed Wire Testing?
An **Electrical Installation Condition Report (EICR)** is the MOT for your building's electrical system. Over time, connections loosen, wires degrade, and safety devices can fail.

Under the **Health and Safety at Work Act 1974**, you have a legal duty to ensure your electrical equipment is safe. Failure to do so can invalidate your insurance and lead to prosecution.
