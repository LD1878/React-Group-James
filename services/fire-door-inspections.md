title: Fire Door Inspections
description: Certified inspections to BS 8214 standards. We check gaps, seals, and hinges to ensure your fire doors save lives.
service_type: Fire Safety
steps:
  - title: Gap Analysis
    desc: We measure the gap between leaf and frame. It must be between 2mm and 4mm to be compliant.
  - title: Intumescent Seal Check
    desc: We verify that heat-expanding seals are present, continuous, and not painted over.
  - title: Force Testing
    desc: We test the self-closing device to ensure the door latches fully from any angle.
  - title: Asset Tagging
    desc: We apply a QR code or unique ID to every door, creating a digital register for your "Golden Thread" compliance.
faqs:
  - q: How often do fire doors need checking?
    a: For residential buildings over 11m, flat entrance doors must be checked annually, and communal doors quarterly (every 3 months).
  - q: Do I need to replace a failed door?
    a: Not always. Many doors can be repaired (e.g., new hinges, new seals, or re-hanging) to bring them back to compliance.
  - q: What report do I get?
    a: You get a Pass/Fail report for every single door, including photos of failures and a cost breakdown for repairs.

## The First Line of Defense
A fire door is a critical safety device. In a fire, it holds back smoke and flames for 30 or 60 minutes, giving occupants time to escape. 

However, a fire door is only effective if it closes properly. A wedged-open door or a door with a 10mm gap provides **zero protection**.

### Common Failures We Find
* **Painted Seals:** Decorators often paint over the smoke brushes, rendering them useless.
* **Broken Closers:** Doors that "bounce" off the frame and don't latch.
* **Incorrect Hinges:** Using standard hinges instead of Grade 13 fire-rated hinges.
