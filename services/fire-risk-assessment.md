## Protect Your People and Property
A Fire Risk Assessment is the cornerstone of your building's safety strategy. It is not just a checkbox exercise; it is a life-saving analysis of how your building performs in an emergency.

**The "Golden Thread" of Information**
New legislation (The Building Safety Act) requires a digital trail of safety information. Our reports are fully digital, cloud-stored, and shareable with fire service inspectors instantly.

### What We Inspect
* **Escape Routes:** Are they clear and signed correctly?
* **Compartmentation:** Will walls and doors stop the spread of smoke?
* **Detection:** Is the fire alarm system appropriate for the risk level (e.g., L1 vs L3)?
