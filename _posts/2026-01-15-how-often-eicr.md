One of the most common questions our team gets is: *"When does my certificate expire?"*

The answer depends entirely on the usage of your building.

## Frequency Guidelines (BS 7671)

* **Commercial Offices:** Every 5 years.
* **Industrial / Warehousing:** Every 3 years.
* **Residential Rentals:** Every 5 years (or at change of occupancy).
* **Swimming Pools / Special Locations:** Every 1 year.
