description: "The Private Rented Sector Scheme explains. Do you need a new EICR for every new tenant? We clarify the legislation."
---

Since the introduction of the *Electrical Safety Standards in the Private Rented Sector (England) Regulations*, the rules for landlords have tightened significantly.

## The 5-Year Mandatory Rule
Every rental property must have a "Satisfactory" EICR performed at least every **5 years**.

## The "Change of Tenancy" Myth
A common misconception is that you need a new EICR every time a tenant moves out.
* **The Law:** You do *not* need a new full EICR if the previous one is still within its 5-year validity and valid for the property.
* **The Recommendation:** We strongly advise a **Visual Inspection** between tenants. Tenants often damage sockets or modify fittings without telling you.

### What is a "Satisfactory" Report?
Your report will be graded.
* **Satisfactory:** No C1 or C2 codes.
* **Unsatisfactory:** Contains C1 (Danger) or C2 (Potential Danger) codes.

If your report is Unsatisfactory, you have **28 days** to fix the issues. You must then provide the council and tenant with written proof of repairs.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I fine the tenant for broken sockets?
If the EICR identifies damage caused by misuse (e.g., smashed sockets), you may be able to deduct repairs from the deposit, provided you have a check-in inventory.

### What about appliances?
The EICR covers the house wiring. It does not cover the fridge, washing machine, or toaster. For these, you need **PAT Testing** (Portable Appliance Testing), which we recommend annually for furnished lets.

### Do I need to give the tenant a copy?
**Yes.** You must give a copy of the EICR to the new tenant *before* they occupy the premises. Failure to do so can invalidate your Section 21 eviction rights.
