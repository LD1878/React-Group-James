The government has recently updated the guidance regarding fire door inspections in multi-occupied residential buildings. If you are a "Responsible Person" under the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005, you need to act now.

## The Key Changes

The new legislation places a higher frequency requirement on inspections for buildings over 11 meters in height.

1.  **Flat Entrance Doors:** Must be inspected annually.
2.  **Communal Doors:** Must be inspected quarterly.
3.  **Reporting:** Any faults must be logged digitally.

### Why do Fire Doors Fail?
In our experience conducting thousands of inspections across the UK, the most common failure points are:

* **Intumescent Strips:** Painted over or missing.
* **Gaps:** Exceeding the 3mm-4mm tolerance.
* **Closers:** Disconnected or too weak to close the door fully.

> **Warning:** A wedged-open fire door provides zero protection. It is a criminal offense to tamper with fire safety devices.
