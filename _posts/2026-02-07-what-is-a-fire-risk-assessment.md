The *Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005* is the primary legislation covering fire safety in the UK. It shifts the responsibility onto the building owner to assess their own risk.

A Fire Risk Assessment (FRA) is not just a piece of paper; it is a living document that evaluates your building's safety.

## The 5 Steps of Risk Assessment (HSE)

1.  **Identify the Hazards:** Sources of ignition (heaters, naked flames) and sources of fuel (cardboard, chemicals).
2.  **Identify People at Risk:** Who works there? Do you have disabled staff? Do the public visit?
3.  **Evaluate & Act:** Can you remove the hazard? If not, how do you reduce the risk? (e.g., installing fire alarms, extinguishers).
4.  **Record & Plan:** If you have 5 or more employees, you *must* write this down. You must also create an emergency plan.
5.  **Review:** An FRA is not a one-off. It must be reviewed regularly (usually annually) or if the building layout changes.



### Who is "Competent" to do it?
The law says a "Competent Person" must conduct the FRA.
While you can do it yourself for a small, low-risk shop, complex buildings (care homes, factories, large offices) require a BAFE SP205 accredited assessor. If you get it wrong and a fire occurs, you are liable for prosecution.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often should an FRA be reviewed?
We recommend an annual review. However, if you knock down a wall, change the use of a room, or have a significant near-miss, you must review it immediately.

### Does the Fire Brigade do it for me?
**No.** The Fire Brigade enforces the law; they do not help you comply with it. They will inspect your FRA, and if it's missing, they can issue an Enforcement Notice or shut down your building.

### Is an FRA the same as an EICR?
No. An EICR checks wires. An FRA checks the holistic safety of the building (exits, signage, alarms, procedures). You need both.
