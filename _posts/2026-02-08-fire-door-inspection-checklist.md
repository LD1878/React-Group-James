When a Reaction Group engineer visits your site, they aren't just "checking if the door closes." They are performing a forensic examination against **BS 8214** standards.

Here is the exact 5-point checklist we use to ensure your building is compliant.

## 1. The Gap Tolerance
The gap between the door leaf and the frame is critical.
* **Top & Sides:** Must be between **2mm and 4mm**.
* **Bottom (Threshold):** Must not exceed **8mm** (or 10mm for smoke control doors).
* **The Failure:** If we can fit a £1 coin (approx 3mm) easily through the top gap, it's likely safe. If we can fit a marker pen, it fails.

## 2. Intumescent Seals
These are the strips that expand in heat to seal the door shut.
* **Check:** Are they painted over? Are they missing chunks?
* **Smoke Seals:** If it's a "Fire & Smoke" door (FD30S), the fluffy brush strip must be continuous and touching the frame.



## 3. Hinges (The Hidden Danger)
A fire door is heavy (often 40kg+).
* **Grade:** Must be **Grade 13** fire-rated hinges.
* **Quantity:** There must be a minimum of **3 hinges** per door.
* **Screws:** No missing screws allowed. This is an instant fail.

## 4. The Self-Closing Device
A fire door that stays open is useless.
* **The Test:** We open the door halfway and let go. It must latch fully into the frame.
* **The Test (Again):** We open it just 5 degrees (barely open) and let go. It must still have the power to latch.

## 5. Glazing (Vision Panels)
* **Markings:** The glass must have an etched stamp indicating it is fire-rated (e.g., Pyran or Georgian Wired).
* **Beading:** The wooden holding strips must be secure and free from damage.

> **Pro Tip:** Never drill holes into a fire door for sign-posting or decorations. This destroys the integrity of the door's core and will result in a failure.
