Managing a school or care home brings a unique set of challenges. You cannot simply turn the power off for 3 hours in the middle of the day, and your "duty of care" is significantly higher due to vulnerable occupants.

## The Frequency Difference
While a standard office needs an EICR every 5 years, we recommend higher frequencies for these sectors:
* **Care Homes:** Every 5 years (Mandatory), but annual visual inspections are vital due to heavy equipment usage (profiling beds, hoists).
* **Schools:** Every 5 years. However, we often split this into **20% per year**. This spreads the cost and means inspections can be done during half-terms.

## The "20% Rule" for Schools
Testing a large secondary school in one go is expensive and disruptive.
By testing 20% of the circuits every year, you achieve 100% compliance over a 5-year cycle.
* **Year 1:** Science Block & Canteen.
* **Year 2:** Sports Hall & Admin.
* **Year 3:** Main Classrooms (Ground Floor).
* **Year 4:** Main Classrooms (First Floor).
* **Year 5:** External lighting & remaining areas.

## Specific Hazards We Look For

### In Care Homes:
* **Medical Equipment:** Sockets powering life-critical equipment must be labelled and prioritized.
* **Trip Hazards:** Trailing leads in resident rooms are a major C2 (Potential Danger) fault.

### In Schools:
* **Science Labs:** Emergency knock-off buttons must be functional.
* **Damage:** Sockets in corridors are prone to impact damage from bags and trolleys. We often recommend metal-clad accessories for durability.

## DBS Checked Engineers
For these sectors, technical skill isn't enough. Reaction Group ensures all engineers visiting schools or care facilities hold an **Enhanced DBS Check**, giving you peace of mind regarding safeguarding protocols.
