Under **BS 5266-1**, simply having green lights above your doors is not enough. You must prove they work when the power actually fails.

There are two distinct types of tests required by law. Missing either one renders your building non-compliant.

## 1. The Monthly "Flick" Test
This is a short functional test.
* **Who does it:** The "Responsible Person" (e.g., Office Manager or Caretaker).
* **Duration:** Short duration (e.g., 30 seconds to 1 minute).
* **The Goal:** To verify the lamp illuminates when the mains power is cut.
* **Record Keeping:** Must be logged in your physical or digital fire logbook.

## 2. The Annual "Full Drain" Test
This is the one most businesses miss.
* **Who does it:** A competent engineer (Reaction Group).
* **Duration:** Full rated duration (usually **3 hours**).
* **The Goal:** To ensure the battery can sustain the light for the full 3 hours required to evacuate a building safely.



### Why Batteries Fail
Emergency lights typically use NiCd or LiFePO4 batteries. Over 3-5 years, these degrade. A light might work for the 30-second monthly test but die after 45 minutes during a real fire. The Annual Drain Test catches this failure.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I do the 3-hour test myself?
Technically yes, but it is risky. If you drain the batteries, you must not reoccupy the building until they recharge (usually 24 hours). Reaction Group engineers often perform these tests on weekends or stagger them to ensure safety coverage.

### What is a "Fish Key"?
A fish key is a small device used to test emergency light switches without turning off the main power to the whole building.

### Do LED emergency lights need testing?
Yes. While the LED bulb lasts longer, the *battery* backing it up still degrades and requires the same BS 5266 testing regime.
