One of the most guarded secrets in the facility management industry is the cost of compliance. At Reaction Group, we believe in transparent pricing.

## How is an EICR Priced?
Commercial Fixed Wire Testing is almost always priced **Per Circuit**.

A "Circuit" is a single fuse or breaker in your distribution board. The more fuses you have, the longer the test takes.

### Estimated Market Rates (2026)
* **Standard Rate (Mon-Fri):** £15.00 - £25.00 per circuit.
* **Out of Hours (Nights/Weekends):** £25.00 - £35.00 per circuit.
* **Minimum Charge:** Most reputable firms have a minimum charge of £150-£250 to cover travel and certification.

## The "Cheap Quote" Trap
If you see a quote for £8.00 per circuit, be careful. This usually implies:
1.  **Sampling:** They only test 20% of the sockets but issue a certificate for 100%.
2.  **Remedial Loading:** They charge low for the test but inflate the cost of fixing the C2 faults.

## Hidden Costs to Watch For
* **Labeling:** Does the price include creating a new circuit chart?
* **Access Equipment:** Do you have high-bay lighting that requires a scissor lift?
* **Thermal Imaging:** Is thermography included in the board inspection?

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I count my circuits?
Go to your Fuse Board (Distribution Board). Count the number of switches (breakers). Do not count the main big switch. If you have 3 boards with 10 switches each, you have roughly 30 circuits.

### Is remedial work extra?
Yes. The EICR is an *inspection*. Fixing the faults is a separate job. However, Reaction Group provides a fixed-price quote for remedials alongside your report.
