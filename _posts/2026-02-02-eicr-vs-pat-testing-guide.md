If you manage a property in the UK, you are likely bombarded with acronyms. The two most common—and most commonly confused—are **EICR** and **PAT**.

While both ensure electrical safety, they cover completely different parts of your building. Failing to distinguish between them can lead to voided insurance and fines of up to £30,000.

## The Core Difference (At a Glance)

| Feature | EICR (Fixed Wire) | PAT (Portable Appliance) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **What it tests** | The hidden wiring inside walls, fuse boards, and sockets. | Anything with a plug (kettles, PCs, heaters). |
| **Legal Status** | **Mandatory** for all rentals & workplaces. | **Required** to demonstrate "duty of care" (HASWA 1974). |
| **Frequency** | Every 5 Years (Commercial/Rental). | Every 1-2 Years (Recommended). |
| **Cost Factor** | High (Per Circuit). | Low (Per Item). |

## What is an EICR?
An **Electrical Installation Condition Report** checks the "hard" wiring of the building. This includes your consumer unit (fuse box), light fittings, and the cabling behind the plaster.

### Common EICR Failures in 2026
* **C1 Code:** Danger present (e.g., exposed live parts). Immediate action required.
* **C2 Code:** Potentially dangerous (e.g., no RCD protection on rental sockets).
* **C3 Code:** Improvement recommended (e.g., old wiring colours).

## What is PAT Testing?
**Portable Appliance Testing** covers equipment that can be moved. If it has a plug, it needs a PAT test. This is crucial for offices with high usage of monitors, kettles, and extension leads.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need an EICR if I have a PAT certificate?
**Yes.** A PAT certificate only covers plugged items. It does not prove your building's wiring is safe. You legally require a valid EICR for rental properties.

### Can the same engineer do both?
Yes, Reaction Group engineers are qualified to perform EICR and PAT testing in a single visit, which often reduces the call-out fee.

### What happens if I ignore these tests?
Under the *Landlord and Tenant Act 1985* and *Health & Safety at Work Act 1974*, you can be prosecuted for negligence if an injury occurs due to faulty electrics.
