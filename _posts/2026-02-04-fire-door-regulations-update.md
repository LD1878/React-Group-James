description: "Are your fire doors compliant with the latest Building Safety Act amendments? A guide for 'Responsible Persons' in multi-occupied buildings."
---

The era of "fit and forget" for fire doors is over. The *Building Safety Act* and the *Fire Safety (England) Regulations* have introduced a digital "Golden Thread" of information that building owners must maintain.

## What has changed in 2026?
For multi-occupied residential buildings over 11 metres in height, the law now demands rigorous checking intervals.

### 1. Flat Entrance Doors
* **Requirement:** Must be inspected annually to your best endeavour.
* **The Check:** Gaps (3mm), seals, hinges, and self-closing devices.

### 2. Communal Fire Doors
* **Requirement:** Must be checked **quarterly** (every 3 months).
* **Scope:** All doors in corridors, stairwells, and risers.

## The "Golden Thread" Explained
You can no longer rely on paper checklists. The Regulator requires a digital trail showing:
1.  When the door was installed.
2.  Who inspected it.
3.  What faults were found.
4.  When the remedial work was completed.

Reaction Group uses a **Digital Asset Tagging** system. We place a QR code on every door, allowing you to scan and see its full compliance history instantly.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the fine for non-compliance?
Unlimited fines and potential prison sentences for the "Responsible Person" if negligence leads to a risk to life.

### My doors are old, do I need to replace them?
Not necessarily. "Nominal" fire doors (older doors) can often be upgraded with new intumescent strips and hinges to meet safety standards. You do not always need a full replacement set.

### Who can inspect a fire door?
A "Competent Person." This is not defined as a specific degree, but using a BAFE-accredited engineer ensures you have proof of competence should you ever be audited.
